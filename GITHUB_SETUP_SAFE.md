## 🔒 **SECURITY: PROTECT SENSITIVE DATA**

### **Create .gitignore File**
Before pushing, create a `.gitignore` file to protect sensitive information:

```
# Environment variables (API keys, secrets)
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.development

# Dependencies
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
logs/
*.log
```

### **Environment Variables Safety**
Your `.env` file (if it exists) contains sensitive API keys and should NEVER be pushed to GitHub. The `.gitignore` file above protects it.

### ✅ **Your Live Site Check**
1. Visit: https://homahealthcarecenter.in
2. Test booking system
3. Check emergency contact: +91-9963721999
4. Verify all integrations work
5. Test mobile responsiveness

### ✅ **GitHub Repository Check**
1. Visit your GitHub repository
2. Verify all code files are there
3. Check that `.env` file is NOT visible (protected)
4. Confirm commit message shows your success
