## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Never commit these to GitHub:
.env                    # Contains API keys
.env.local             # Local environment
.env.production        # Production secrets
```

### **Sensitive Information**
✅ **Safe to commit**:
- Source code
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Public assets

❌ **Never commit**:
- API keys
- Passwords
- Database credentials
- Personal information

### **Making Changes**
```bash
# 1. Make your changes to the code
# 2. Stage changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with descriptive message

# 4. Push to GitHub (auto-deploys to Netlify)
git push origin main
```

### **Checking Status**
```bash
# See what files changed
git status

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# See differences
